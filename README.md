 Final Project for Data Structures 
+
+My project revolves around using weighted graphs to illustrate a virtual representation of near Earth asteroids to be used in theory as a tool to efficiently mine these asteroids for resources, information, or as a way to potentially destroy asteroids that become a threat to the Earth.
+
+
+
+This project will utilize theory and method behind finding the shortest path between two points, the storing of vertices in a graph with weighted distances between each point to calculate the "real" distance between the two objects(either between Earth or separate asteroids). The graph can be thought of a frozen moment of time of the positions of all of these objects. Even though the objects are in a 3-D space of course, the actual distances between them can be thought of as 2-Dimensional edges.

+
+Sources for locations and distances of the asteroids from Earth can be found here: http://www.brera.mi.astro.it/sormano/teca.html 
+
+
+Other qualities of note that these asteroids have include the size of the asteroid which severely impacts its score on the palermo scale which can be read about here: https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/palermo_scale.html
+The scale can be a determining factor in the danger of any given asteroid and therefore the efforts that should be placed in mitigating or nullifying the damage it inflicts upon collision with the Earth.
+
+The complexity of constantly accelerating objects in space (due to the elliptical orbits of these bodies) makes predicting the motion of the asteroids, based on the gravitational pull and respective velocities of the objects during the "travel" time of the explorer, far too complex. Therefore the velocities and consequently the positions of the objects will not be considered beyond their initial positions.
