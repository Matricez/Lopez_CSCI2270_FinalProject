Hello!

Thanks for reading this. This is my readme update.

Project Summary:

My project's goal originally was to make an asteroid mining program, however upon working through the project with an instructor this proved to likely consume far too much time so I resolved to make an interesting representation of our solar system with a graph.
I had to scour the internet (not that deeply) to find data on the distances of planets relative to each other in an average setting, given that they have elliptical orbits distances are never constant.

From this site: http://www.planetsedu.com/distances-between-the-planets/ 

and this site: https://www.universetoday.com/15462/how-far-are-the-planets-from-the-sun/ 

Using dijkstra's algorithm I wanted to find the shortest path between the planets and also make a game out of surviving the trip by acquiring the correct resources to survive the harsh conditions of space. However, I ran out of time and energy to do much more thant what I did, because there was simply too much going on this week. Unfortunately I did not get Dijkstra's algorithm to work properly.



How To Run:

No third party libraries are required, so there is nothing else to it to run this program other than to make sure it goes into your machine in the same directory.

System Requirements:

This program can be run on any machine with the proper GCC compiler. CODE::BLOCKS for example has downloads available for most operating systems, so if you download that this could easily be run. On a linux or unix based OS this can be ran through terminal with no CLAS needed.

Issues/Bugs:
Well the project has a lot more potential so the bugs didn't really come out as not a lot of testing was done.
